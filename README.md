### Agronomy Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.AGRO)
Ontology of agronomic practices, agronomic techniques, and agronomic
variables used in agronomic experiments

### Plant Stress Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.PSO)
The Plant Stress Ontology describes biotic and abiotic stresses that a
plant may encounter.

## upper

### Basic Formal Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.BFO)
The upper level ontology upon which OBO Foundry ontologies are built.

### Relation Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.RO)
The OBO Relations Ontology (RO) is a collection of OWL relations
(ObjectProperties) intended for use across a wide variety of
biological ontologies.

## anatomy and development

### Cell Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.CL)
The Cell Ontology is a structured controlled vocabulary for cell types
in animals.

### The Plant Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.PO)
The Plant Ontology is a structured vocabulary and database resource
that links plant anatomy, morphology and growth and development to
plant genomics data.

### Uberon multi-species anatomy ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.UBERON)
An integrated cross-species anatomy ontology covering animals and
bridging multiple species-specific ontologies.

## biological systems

### Genotype Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.GENO)
An integrated ontology for representing the genetic variations
described in genotypes, and their causal relationships to phenotype
and diseases.

### Gene Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.GO)
An ontology for describing the function of genes and gene products.

### Interaction Network Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.INO)
The Interaction Network Ontology (INO) is an ontology in the domain of
interactions and interaction networks. INO represents general and
species-neutral types of interactions and interaction networks, and
their related elements and relations.

### Neuro Behavior Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.NBO)
An ontology of human and animal behaviours and behavioural phenotypes.

## chemistry and biochemistry

### Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (net.wikipunk.rdf.CHEBI)
A structured classification of molecular entities of biological
interest focusing on 'small' chemical compounds.

### Chemical Information Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.CHEMINF)
Includes terms for the descriptors commonly used in cheminformatics
software applications and the algorithms which generate them.

### Molecular Process Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.MOP)
Processes at the molecular level.

### Name Reaction Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.RXNO)
Connects organic name reactions to their roles in an organic synthesis
and to processes in MOP.

### Sequence Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.SO)
A structured controlled vocabulary for sequence annotation, for the
exchange of annotation data and for the description of sequence
objects in databases.

## diet, metabolomics, and nutrition

### Compositional Dietary Nutrition Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.CDNO)
CDNO provides structured terminologies to describe nutritional
attributes of material entities that contribute to human diet.

### Food Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.FOODON)
A broadly scoped ontology representing entities which bear a “food
role”. It encompasses materials in natural ecosystems and agriculture
that are consumed by humans and domesticated animals. This includes
any generic (unbranded) raw or processed food material found in
processing plants, markets, stores or food distribution points. FoodOn
also imports nutritional component and dietary pattern terms from
other OBO Foundry ontologies to support interoperability in diet and
nutrition research.

## environment

## health

### Symptom Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.SYMP)
An ontology of disease symptoms, with symptoms encompasing perceived
changes in function, sensations or appearance reported by a patient
indicative of a disease.

### Human Disease Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.DOID)
An ontology for describing the classification of human diseases
organized by etiology.

### Cardiovascular Disease Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.CVDO)
An ontology to describe entities related to cardiovascular diseases.

### Medical Action Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.MAXO)
An ontology to represent medically relevant actions, procedures,
therapies, interventions, and recommendations.

### Emotion Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.MFOEM)
An ontology of affective phenomena such as emotions, moods, appraisals
and subjective feelings.

### The Mental Functioning Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.MF)
The Mental Functioning Ontology is an overarching ontology for all
aspects of mental functioning.

### National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (net.wikipunk.rdf.NCIT)
The NCIt OBO Edition project aims to increase integration of the NCIt
with OBO Library ontologies. NCIt is a reference terminology that
includes broad coverage of the cancer domain, including cancer related
diseases, findings and abnormalities.

### Ontology for General Medical Science (net.wikipunk.rdf.OGMS)
An ontology for representing treatment of disease and diagnosis and on
carcinomas and other pathological entities.

## information

## information technology

### The Statistical Methods Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.STATO)
STATO is a general-purpose STATistics Ontology. Its aim is to provide
coverage for processes such as statistical tests, their conditions of
application, and information needed or resulting from statistical
methods, such as probability distributions, variables, spread and
variation metrics. STATO also covers aspects of experimental design
and description of plots and graphical representations commonly used
to provide visual cues of data distribution or layout and to assist
review of the results.

## investigations

### Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (net.wikipunk.rdf.OBI)
The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is build in a
collaborative, international effort and will serve as a resource for
annotating biomedical investigations, including the study design,
protocols and instrumentation used, the data generated and the types
of analysis performed on the data. This ontology arose from the
Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology (FuGO) and will contain
both terms that are common to all biomedical investigations, including
functional genomics investigations and those that are more domain
specific.

## microbiology

## organisms

## phenotype

### Genotype Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.GENO)
An integrated ontology for representing the genetic variations
described in genotypes, and their causal relationships to phenotype
and diseases.
