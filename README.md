## agriculture

### Agronomy Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.AGRO)
Ontology of agronomic practices, agronomic techniques, and agronomic
variables used in agronomic experiments

### Plant Stress Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.PSO)
The Plant Stress Ontology describes biotic and abiotic stresses that a
plant may encounter.

## upper

### Basic Formal Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.BFO)
The upper level ontology upon which OBO Foundry ontologies are built.

### Relation Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.RO)
The OBO Relations Ontology (RO) is a collection of OWL relations
(ObjectProperties) intended for use across a wide variety of
biological ontologies.

## anatomy and development

### Cell Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.CL)
The Cell Ontology is a structured controlled vocabulary for cell types
in animals.

### Fungal gross anatomy (net.wikipunk.rdf.FAO)
A structured controlled vocabulary for the anatomy of fungi.

### The Plant Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.PO)
The Plant Ontology is a structured vocabulary and database resource
that links plant anatomy, morphology and growth and development to
plant genomics data.

## biological systems

## chemistry and biochemistry

### Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (net.wikipunk.rdf.CHEBI)
A structured classification of molecular entities of biological
interest focusing on 'small' chemical compounds.

## diet, metabolomics, and nutrition

### Compositional Dietary Nutrition Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.CDNO)
CDNO provides structured terminologies to describe nutritional
attributes of material entities that contribute to human diet.

### Food Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.FOODON)
A broadly scoped ontology representing entities which bear a “food
role”. It encompasses materials in natural ecosystems and agriculture
that are consumed by humans and domesticated animals. This includes
any generic (unbranded) raw or processed food material found in
processing plants, markets, stores or food distribution points. FoodOn
also imports nutritional component and dietary pattern terms from
other OBO Foundry ontologies to support interoperability in diet and
nutrition research.

## environment

## health

### Symptom Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.SYMP)
An ontology of disease symptoms, with symptoms encompasing perceived
changes in function, sensations or appearance reported by a patient
indicative of a disease.

### Human Disease Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.DOID)
An ontology for describing the classification of human diseases
organized by etiology.

## information

## information technology

### The Statistical Methods Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.STATO)
STATO is a general-purpose STATistics Ontology. Its aim is to provide
coverage for processes such as statistical tests, their conditions of
application, and information needed or resulting from statistical
methods, such as probability distributions, variables, spread and
variation metrics. STATO also covers aspects of experimental design
and description of plots and graphical representations commonly used
to provide visual cues of data distribution or layout and to assist
review of the results.

## investigations

### Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (net.wikipunk.rdf.OBI)
The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is build in a
collaborative, international effort and will serve as a resource for
annotating biomedical investigations, including the study design,
protocols and instrumentation used, the data generated and the types
of analysis performed on the data. This ontology arose from the
Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology (FuGO) and will contain
both terms that are common to all biomedical investigations, including
functional genomics investigations and those that are more domain
specific.

## microbiology

## organisms

## phenotype

### Genotype Ontology (net.wikipunk.rdf.GENO)
An integrated ontology for representing the genetic variations
described in genotypes, and their causal relationships to phenotype
and diseases.
